# Firebase Messaging

Firebase Messaging App is an android application where the users can contact each other through the app on their phones and send text messages. It is based on the firebase database system and all the messages from different users are stored on the backend in that database. This can be further extended by adding one to one messaging functionality which is not yet present in this application.
